-   [Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS](https://releases.ubuntu.com/focal/)

## GPU
 * ****Nvidia** :** Nvidia is graphic processing unit. It is render a graphic in a machine that helps to support a heavy graphic game,high resolution video rendering,image processing etc.
 
 * **CUDA Stack :**  CUDA stands for Compute Unified Device Architecture. it is a parallel computing platform and programming model developed by Nvidia for general computing on its own graphics processing units.
 ## Programming Stack
* **Python** : It is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its helps to developing websites and software, task automation, data analysis, and data visualization.

* **Javascript ES5** : ES stand for ECMAScript. ECMAScript 2009, also known as ES5 was the first major revision to JavaScript. ECMAScript is a trademarked scripting language specification that is defined by ECMA International. It was created to standardize JavaScript. ECMAScript is used for client-side scripting of the World Wide Web.
* **NodeJS :** Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.
* **C++ :**  C++ is one of the world's most popular programming languages. C++ is a cross-platform language that can be used to create high-performance applications.
* **HTML5** : HTML5 is a markup language used for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web. It is the fifth and last major HTML version that is a World.
* **CSS3 :**  CSS stand for Cascading Style Sheets. Its help to designed a web page that increases user interface and look & feel.
* **WebGL :**  WebGL (Web Graphics Library) is a JavaScript API for rendering high-performance interactive 3D and 2D graphics within any compatible web browser without the use of plug-ins.
* **Angular JS :** Angular JS is an open source JavaScript framework that is used to build web applications. It can be freely used, changed and shared by anyone. Angular Js is developed by Google.
* **Keras :** Keras is an open-source software library that provides a Python interface for artificial neural networks. Keras acts as an interface for the TensorFlow library.
* **Tensorflow :** TensorFlow is a free and open-source software library for machine learning and artificial intelligence. Tensorflow is a symbolic math library based on dataflow and differentiable programming.
* **PyTorch :**  PyTorch is an open source machine learning library based on the Torch library, used for applications such as computer vision and natural language processing, primarily developed by Facebook's AI Research lab.


## Message Interface
 * **Kafka:** Kafka is a fault tolerant, scalable and distributed asynchronous ***messaging queue***. A party called Producer sends stream of messages to Kafka consumed by another party called Consumer. Messages are stored in the form of bytes and also ***always in the order*** for retention period. It is used in LinkedIn, Netflix, Twitter, Microsoft applications.
 * **RabbitMQ:** RabbitMQ is an open-source message-broker software (sometimes called message-oriented middleware) that originally implemented the ***Advanced Message Queuing Protocol*** (AMQP) and has since been extended with a plug-in architecture Plug-in computing to support  Streaming Text Oriented Messaging Protocol (STOMP), MQ Telemetry Transport (MQTT), and other protocols.
 It ***doesn't support message ordering*** and also ***doesn't guarantee atomicity*** but It ***specify message priority***.
 
 * **ZeroMQ:** ZeroMQ (also known as ØMQ, 0MQ, or zmq) looks like an embeddable networking library but acts like a concurrency framework. It gives you sockets that carry atomic messages across various transports like in-process, inter-process, TCP, and multicast.
 * **Celery:** Celery is typically used with a web framework such as Django, Flask or Pyramid to run batch jobs in the background on a regular schedule. 
 ## RDBMS
 
 * **PostgreSQL:** PostgreSQL is also known as Postgres. It is a free and open-source relational database management system. t is used as the primary data store or data warehouse for many web, mobile, geospatial, and analytics applications.
 
 * **PostGIS:** PostGIS is a spatial ***database extension*** for the the PostgreSQL DBMS. It provides geometric processing, geographic processing, raster processing and analysis in the database, 3D surface and volume support, topo geometry functions and topologies, geocoding and address standardization and also includes tools for loading data.
 ## NOSQL
 **MongoDB:** MongoDB is a document database with the scalability and flexibility that you want with the querying and indexing that you need. It is popular with developers of all kinds who are building scalable applications.
 ## Array DB
 **Rasdaman:** Rasdaman ("raster data manager") is an Array Database Management System which adds capabilities for storage and retrieval of massive multi-dimensional arrays, such as sensor, image, simulation, and statistics data.
 # Documentation
 * **Markdown:** Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor.
 * **Asciidoc:** AsciiDoc is a text document format for writing notes, documentation, articles, books, eBooks, slideshows, web pages.
 * **TeX/LATeX:** LaTeX is “really just TeX with macros”. TeX is all about giving you powerful algorithms and commands to specify even the tiniest detail to make documents look pretty. LaTeX is a set of macros built on top of TeX.
 * **Git:** Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.
